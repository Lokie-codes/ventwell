### **System Design: VentWell Emotional Wellness Platform**

This document details the system architecture for VentWell, a private journaling application with an AI-guided conversational interface. The design prioritizes security, scalability, and modularity to deliver a safe and effective user experience.

#### **1. Guiding Principles**

  * **Security First (Zero Trust):** Every component is designed with the assumption that trust must be earned and verified. Data is protected at rest, in transit, and during processing.
  * **Privacy by Design:** The system minimizes data collection and ensures user data is handled according to strict privacy protocols (GDPR, HIPAA principles).
  * **Modular & Scalable:** The architecture is broken into independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently to meet demand.
  * **Resilience & Reliability:** The system is designed to be fault-tolerant and provide a consistent user experience, even during partial service outages.

#### **2. High-Level Architecture**

The system follows a **microservices-oriented architecture**. The core components are the client application, a backend API gateway, a core backend service for business logic, and a specialized AI service for conversation processing.

#### **3. Component Deep Dive**

**3.1. Client Application (React Native)**

  * **Responsibilities:**
      * **UI/UX:** Renders the user interface, including the chat screen, journal list, and settings.
      * **State Management:** Manages application state (e.g., user session, current conversation). A library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand will be used.
      * **Secure Storage:** Stores authentication tokens (JWTs) securely using the device's Keychain (iOS) or Keystore (Android).
      * **Client-Side Encryption:** Before sending any journal data to the backend, the client encrypts it using a key derived from the user's password. This ensures the backend never sees unencrypted data at rest.
      * **API Communication:** Interacts with the backend via a secure RESTful API over HTTPS.
      * **Offline Support:** Caches journal entries locally (e.g., using WatermelonDB or SQLite) to allow for offline access and composition, syncing with the server when a connection is available.

**3.2. API Gateway**

  * **Responsibilities:**
      * **Single Point of Entry:** Acts as the sole entry point for all client requests.
      * **Request Routing:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate backend service (e.g., `/journal` to Core Backend, `/analyze` to AI Service).
      * **Authentication & Authorization:** Verifies the user's JWT on every request before forwarding it.
      * **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Protects backend services from abuse and DDoS attacks.
      * **Request/Response Transformation:** Can be used to format requests and responses if needed.

**3.3. Core Backend Service (Django REST Framework)**

  * **Responsibilities:**
      * **Business Logic:** Handles user profile management, CRUD operations for journal entries, and orchestrates the conversation flow.
      * **User Management:** Manages user accounts, password hashing (using Argon2), and profile information.
      * **Orchestration:** When a user sends a message, this service receives the encrypted text, forwards it to the AI Service for analysis, receives the AI's response, and stores the conversation turn in the database.
      * **Database Interaction:** Manages all communication with the MongoDB database.
      * **API Endpoints:**
          * `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`
          * `GET /journal/entries`, `POST /journal/entries`
          * `POST /journal/entries/{id}/interact` (sends a message)
          * `GET /exercises`

**3.4. AI Service (TensorFlow/PyTorch with a Python web framework like FastAPI)**

  * **Responsibilities:**
      * **NLP Processing:** This is the brain of the application. It's a stateless service that receives text and performs analysis.
      * **Phase Detection & Guidance:** Determines the current phase of the conversation (Validation, Expression, Reframing, Action) and generates the appropriate empathetic or Socratic response.
      * **Crisis Detection:** Employs a specific model trained to recognize patterns of self-harm or severe distress. If detected, it returns a high-priority "CRISIS" flag in its response.
      * **API Endpoint:**
          * `POST /analyze`: Accepts `{ "text": "...", "conversation_history": [...] }` and returns `{ "response_text": "...", "phase": "reframing", "is_crisis": false }`.
      * **Decoupling:** Running as a separate service allows it to be scaled independently (e.g., on GPU-powered instances) without affecting the core backend.

**3.5. Database (MongoDB)**

  * **Rationale:** MongoDB's document-oriented structure is ideal for storing semi-structured data like journal entries and conversational threads.
  * **Key Collections:**
      * `users`: Stores user profile information, hashed passwords, and salts for deriving encryption keys.
      * `journal_entries`: A collection for each journal session. Includes `user_id`, `created_at`, and an encrypted title.
      * `ai_conversations`: Stores individual messages within a journal entry. Each document contains `entry_id`, `timestamp`, `sender` ('user' or 'ai'), `encrypted_content`, and the `phase` of the conversation at that point. This structure makes it easy to reconstruct a full conversation.

#### **4. Data Flow: Creating a New Journal Entry**

This flow illustrates how the components work together for the app's core function.

1.  **Client -\> Backend:** User types a message and hits send. The React Native app encrypts the message content. It sends a `POST` request to `/journal/entries/{id}/interact` with the encrypted payload.
2.  **Request Validation:** The API Gateway validates the JWT token and forwards the request to the Core Backend.
3.  **Backend -\> AI Service:** The Core Backend receives the encrypted message. It temporarily decrypts the text *in memory*. It then makes a `POST` request to the AI Service's `/analyze` endpoint, sending the plain text message and a history of the current conversation.
4.  **AI Processing:** The AI Service analyzes the text, determines the conversational phase, detects for crisis, and generates a response. It sends this response back to the Core Backend.
5.  **Data Persistence:** The Core Backend takes the AI's response text. It encrypts both the user's original message and the AI's response using the user's key. It then saves both messages as new documents in the `ai_conversations` collection, linking them to the journal entry.
6.  **Backend -\> Client:** The Core Backend sends the AI's (unencrypted) response text back to the client.
7.  **UI Update:** The client receives the AI's response and displays it in the chat interface, completing the loop.

#### **5. Security & Compliance Strategy**

  * **Encryption:**
      * **In Transit:** All communication uses **TLS 1.3**.
      * **At Rest:** Data in MongoDB is **fully encrypted**. The encryption key for user content is derived on the client from the user's password and a unique salt stored on the server. The server *never* stores the user's password or their final encryption key. This makes the database unreadable without the user's password.
  * **Crisis Intervention:** If the AI Service returns `is_crisis: true`, the Core Backend logs the event for review (with anonymized data) and sends a specific "CRISIS\_RESPONSE" type to the client. The client is hardcoded to display a non-AI, pre-written message that provides immediate access to resources like the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, overriding the normal chat UI.
  * **Compliance:**
      * **HIPAA:** The architecture is designed to be HIPAA-compliant. All PHI (Protected Health Information) is encrypted, access is strictly controlled and logged, and the system is deployed in a HIPAA-eligible environment (e.g., AWS). A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) would be signed with cloud providers.
      * **GDPR:** The system will support the "right to be forgotten" through data deletion APIs. User consent for data processing will be explicitly obtained during onboarding.

#### **6. Scalability & Reliability**

  * **Backend Services:** Both the Core Backend and AI Service will be containerized (using Docker) and deployed via an orchestrator like Kubernetes. This allows for horizontal scaling by simply adding more containers to handle increased load.
  * **Database:** MongoDB will be deployed as a **replica set** for high availability and automated failover. For massive scale, it can be sharded by `user_id` to distribute the load across multiple clusters.
  * **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring (e.g., using the ELK Stack or Datadog) will be implemented across all services to detect anomalies, track performance, and diagnose issues quickly.
