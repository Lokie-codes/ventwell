## Vision Statement

## Why 'Just Venting' Isn't Enough

Unguided venting can lead to rumination, reinforcing negative neural pathways—the "Temporary Relief Trap." VentWell guides users toward constructive emotional regulation.

### The Rumination Cycle (The Trap)
```
Feel Distress → Vent without guidance → Fleeting relief → Issue persists → Cycle repeats & strengthens
```

### The Constructive Process (The Goal)
```
Feel Distress → Guided Expression & Validation → Cognitive Reframing & Insight → Actionable Steps → Coping Skills
```
